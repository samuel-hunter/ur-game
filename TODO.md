# TODO

- Investigate API plan
- Streamline some binary deployment method for ur-game, use Roswell for it.
- Fix sourcehut builds github mirror
- Refactor API, use HATEOAS. Don't even mention REST, because it's not. Really
  make modules for both ends to take advantage of it.
- Decouple board routes from front-end
- Rewrite game engine, make it general rules engine if needed.
- Setup some command macros or something for the controller layer. Any way to
  separate the current code between handling specific requests.
