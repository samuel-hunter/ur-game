# Rules

* You win the game by getting all your seven pieces from one end to
  the other.
* You roll marked four dice, and the sum of all dice with marks up is
  how much you can move a single piece on your turn.
* If your piece lands on a rosette, you gain an extra turn.
* You can jump over or capture enemy pieces, but you cannot capture
  pieces that are your own, or are on a rosette.
